Children who are excluded from vaccination can travel to the bloc with their family, if they’ve had a negative test no more than 72 hours before arrival.
Though it remains to be seen how each EU nation will welcome foreign travelers, the agreement at the EU level is a welcome step by the battered tourism industry.
“We know that consumers want to be able to travel this summer and so we welcome that European countries could enable those who are vaccinated could travel without the need for testing,” a spokesperson for the airline easyJet told CNBC via email.
“It is of course important that this is implemented in a simple way to ensure it is easy for passengers,” the same spokesperson said.
The EU decision could be particularly important for British tourists, who are now outside of the EU and represent one of the most important markets for tourism-reliant EU nations. In addition, people in the United States, Israel and other highly vaccinated parts of the world are also likely to benefit from the EU’s stance.</string>
